- pro tip: Make sure the game supports whatever text you are spamming, ex: league does not support some unicode characters (â —)

### usage

put whatever you are spamming in file `<text_file>`, and sepearte each message with a newline.. look at `spam.txt` examplel file for details.

as for the bind file dont mess with it, just add whatever key you want in the list. the first key will bind to the first message, et cetera!
